# Neverday.

This is my 1st milestone project in User-Centric Frontend Development. An assignment from [CodeInstitute](https://codeinstitute.net/). 
The band wich this website is for, is a real band, and its called Neverday.  

Neverday plays punk/rock with influences from metal, hardcore and skatepunk. Combining energy and catchy melodies with lyrics about love, death and anxiety.

And guess what, I play with the band.
