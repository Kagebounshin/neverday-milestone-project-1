# Neverday

This website is for the punkrock band called Neverday, 

## UX

This site is for fans who likes to get to know the band and see what they are up to. To find information about upcoming shows, how to get tickets for the shows, and find out where they could listend to the music, see videos, and social media accounts.
 
Also for future employes that wishes to hire the band to play a show. They will get simple instructions on how to do so.

* As a fan I could get access to all the tour dates, tickets, music, videos, and all the social media accounts.

* As an employer I should get access on how to book the band. 

links to mock ups, wireframes etc.


## Features

Here's what you can do on the website.

* You can toggle between the home, gallery and Shows pages.
* At the homepage you can find information about the band, how to contact the band, find out were to hire the band, and links to music and social media.
* At the gallery page you can see pictures of the band embedded from [Instagram](https://instagram.com/neverdayofficial?igshid=js84a4ahj2fy).
* At the Shows page you can see all the upcoming tour dates, links to were you cant purchase tickets. And you can make a request on hiring the band.

Further ahead I would like to implement a videos page so the user can see the bands music videos etc. 
And a music page so you can listend to the music directley on the site, also read the lyrics to every recorded song.
