<h2><img src="./assets/images/images-readme/am-i-responsive.png"></h2>
                                
This is my first milestone project in User-Centric Frontend Development. An assignment from [CodeInstitute](https://codeinstitute.net/). 
The band wich this website is for, is a real band, and its called Neverday.  

Neverday plays punk/rock with influences from metal, hardcore and skatepunk. Combining energy and catchy melodies with lyrics about love, death and anxiety.

And guess what, I play with the band.

### Design

---

- Color Scheme
    - The website has a white background, and two diffrent types of light grey to make an nice transaction between the sections. 

- Typography
    - I've used the Roboto font from [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?preview.text_type=custom#glyphs), I think its clean and looks really nice. The fall back font is sans-serif. 

- Images 
    - I have two images in a carousel right at the homepage, the first one is the bands logo, and a text with some additional information about our music. The second images is with the grimreaper and our logo, and a text with information on how to sign up for the newsletter. 

### Wireframes

--- 

* Home, Gallery and shows page.
